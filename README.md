# Introduction

This small library is meant to provide some handy functions which are missing in DOM manipulating frameworks like jQuery or others.

And it doesn't want to be another armed-to-teeth full featured framework (might also be hard-to-learn).

Its goal is providing a minimalist building foundation for modern web pages.
